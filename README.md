# Balanced Groupings Problem

This program solves the balances groupings problem using kotlin as the programming language.

In order to run this program you need to have installed in your computer
the kotlin standalone compiler (which can be found here)[https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html]
and the gradle build tool (can be downloaded here)[https://gradle.org/].

Once you install gradle and the kotlin compiler you can run this program
by navigating to the directory where you downloaded in the command line
and run the following command "./gradlew test".
